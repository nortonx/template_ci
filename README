This project includes:

-CodeIgniter Reactor 2.0;
-jQuery 1.4.4
-jQuery UI 1.8.10 (with themes: blitzer, sunny and ui-lightness)
-960gs CSS Framework

I only made this to help me with a standard setup for simple web projects using those frameworks.

Feel free to modify, add a suggestion or anything you want.

bye,

norton
