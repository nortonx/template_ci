Hi, my name is Norton and I am a web developper.
The kind of work available for me here in my town is kinda boring and go
agains the DRY principles. So, I Downloaded the CodeIgniter Reactor 2, the most
stable jQuery Library and jQueryUI as well, plus, the CKEditor and the super 960gs.

Thanks for Nathan Smith

This project includes:

-CodeIgniter Reactor 2.0.1;
-jQuery 1.4.4
-jQuery UI 1.8.10 (with themes: blitzer, sunny, ui-lightness);
-960gs CSS Framework;
-CKEditor; 

I only made this to help me with a standard setup for simple web projects using those frameworks.

Feel free to modify, add a suggestion or anything you want.

bye,

norton
